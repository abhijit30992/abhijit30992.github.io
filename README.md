# WHY GATE?
When I was in third year of my engineering studies, I always wondered what to do after engineering. My batch was first so there were no seniors to follow. On the same time I definitely wouldn’t have followed them either. Following people from same standard never made sense to me. At that time I only had one focus and that was to reach out to IITs and explore what is next to IITs.

Things have changed a lot during years and definitely the reasons to go ahead with GATE preparation also changed. Earlier GATE was only useful for M.Tech admissions but these days it’s also used recruitment process. In this post I would like to bring some important reasons to go ahead and focus on GATE preparation.

The few most important reasons are

## Gateway To Higher Studies
This is the most important and well known reason for GATE preparation. Most of us miss IITs at B.Tech level and feel that we must go ahead to knock doors of IITs before we land in jobs and living issues. GATE exam is the only way to try that in a very straight forward way. If you ask me why to do M.Tech itself, please refer to Why To Do M.Tech.

## UPSs Recruitment
This is another good reason to prepare for GATE. Even if you don’t want to go for higher studies, you need to have a good GATE score to get into many PSUs, you can refer to PSUs recruiting through GATE Exam. In 2012 as many as four PSUs considered GATE score as basic qualification criteria for their requirements. I am sure in future, if not all, many other PSUs and private sector companies would make it qualifying criteria for interviews.

## An Excellent Opportunity To Beat The Best
You think that your concepts are much better than the topper in class, but still you don’t get good scores in college and university exams because of your worthless teacher. You also think that writing stories and mugging books and giving a same print in answer sheets is not your ball game then you must play this GATE game. This is a completely different ball game where you beat the long runners with trick and practice and the best is computer evaluate you not a teacher who thinks that you are dumb and give marks based on impression you have on him
